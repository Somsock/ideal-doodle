# self-source-printing

Version 0 (beta) - in development towards a working application.

Purpose: Help assist indie creators who are interested in understanding the cost feasibility of a self-sourced book printing project (rather than print-on-demand services). Application calculates expected quantity/units creators will need to sell to earn back production costs, or breakeven. 

Users need to provide the following inputs: unit price, printer quotes, and print volume. 

This is for creators who are interested in: 
- low-volume book-print runs (1000 units for fewer) 
- using digital printers (not off-set printers)
- Self-sourcing supply chain (not print-on-demand services).

This version currently incorporates the following: unit cost, breakeven quantity, potential profits, and total revenue.

Next version wishlist (To-Do List): 
- input validation that takes into account "cancel" (currently only validate whether or not the input is an integer or a double) 
- web application and .exe
- slightly sassy message when the user input negative numbers or zero for book quantity and printer quotes (as part of input validation)
- marginal production cost and marginal revenue/profit
- taxes and other fees for users to understand how much money they will actually keep after taxes and fees
- a table for comparing different book quantity bundles 
- a back up system for if user wants to revisit previous tables or bundles
- price conversion (currently usd only)
- book weight and shipping costs (also conversion to kg)
- tutorial (once the application is usable)
- a way to export the data so users can save the data

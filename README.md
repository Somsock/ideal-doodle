# ideal-doodle 
Version 0 (beta) - in development towards a working application.

Purpose: Help assist indie creators who are interested in understanding the cost feasibility of a self-sourced book printing project (rather than print-on-demand services). Application calculates expected quantity/units creators will need to sell to earn back production costs, or breakeven. 

Users should provide inputs (list inputs: unit price, printer quotes, print volume). 

This is for creators who are interested in: 
- low-volume book-print runs (1000 units for fewer) 
- using digital printers (not off-set printers)
- Self-sourcing supply chain (not print-on-demand services).

This version currently incorporates: breakeven quantity, potential profits, total revenue. 

Tutorial for how to use this application here.

Next version wishlist: 
- input validation that takes into account "cancel" (currently only validate whether or not the input is an integer or a double) and maybe be a little sassy when the user input negative numbers or zero for book quantity and costs
- web application and .exe
- marginal cost and marginal benefit
- taxes and other fees for users to understand how much money they will actually keep after taxes and fees
- a table for comparing different book quantity bundles 
- a back up system for if user wants to revisit previous tables or bundles
- price conversion (currently usd only)
- book weight and shipping costs (also conversion to kg)
